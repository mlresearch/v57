title: Inferring Non-resettable Mealy Machines with n States
abstract: Automata inference algorithms are used to extract behavioural models of
  software components. However, when the software system cannot be reset, inference
  must be done from a single trace. This paper proposes an active learning algorithm
  that can infer a Mealy model under the assumption that the number of the states
  of the machine is known and that a characterization set for it is provided. This
  algorithm improves on a previous paper that used a looser assumption on the number
  of states. The complexity is polynomial in the number of states of the Mealy machine.
