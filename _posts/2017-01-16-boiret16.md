title: Learning Top-Down Tree Transducers with Regular Domain Inspection
abstract: We study the problem of how to learn tree transformations on a given regular
  tree domain from a finite sample of input-output examples. We assume that the target
  tree transformation can be defined by a deterministic top-down tree transducer with
  regular domain inspection (DTOPIreg). An RPNI style learning algorithm that solves
  this problem  in polynomial time and with polynomially many examples was presented
  at Pods’2010, but restricted to the case of path-closed regular domains. In this
  paper, we show that this restriction can be removed.  For this, we present a new
  normal form for DTOPIreg by extending the Myhill-Nerode theorem for DTOP to regular
  domain inspections in a nontrivial manner. The RPNI style learning algorithm can
  also be lifted but becomes more involved too.
