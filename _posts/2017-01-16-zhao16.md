title: Sequence Prediction Using Neural Network Classiers
abstract: Being able to guess the next element of a sequence is an important question
  in many fields. In this paper we present our approaches used in the Sequence Prediction
  ChallengE (SPiCe), whose goal is to compare the different approaches to that problem
  on the same datasets. We model sequence prediction as a classification problem and
  adapt three different neural network models to tackle it. The experimental results
  show that our neural network based approaches produce better overall performance
  than the baseline approaches provided in the competition. In the actual competition,
  we won the second place using these approaches.
