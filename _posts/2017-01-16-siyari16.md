title: The Generalized Smallest Grammar Problem
abstract: The Smallest Grammar Problem – the problem of finding the smallest context-free
  grammar that generates exactly one given sequence – has never been successfully
  applied to grammatical inference. We investigate the reasons and propose an extended
  formulation that seeks to minimize non-recursive grammars, instead of straight-line
  programs. In addition, we provide very efficient algorithms that approximate the
  minimization problem of this class of grammars. Our empirical evaluation shows that
  we are able to find smaller models than the current best approximations to the Smallest
  Grammar Problem on standard benchmarks, and that the inferred rules capture much
  better the syntactic structure of natural language.
