title: Model Selection of Sequence Prediction Algorithms by Compression
abstract: This paper describes estimating performance of sequence prediction algorithms
  and hyperparameters by compressing the training dataset itself with the probablities
  predicted by the trained model. With such estimation we can automate the selection
  and tuning process of learning algorithms. Spectral learning algorithm are experimented
  with.
