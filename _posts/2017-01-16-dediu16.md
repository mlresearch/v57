title: Query Learning Automata with Helpful Labels
abstract: In the active learning framework, a modified query learning algorithm benefiting
  by a nontrivial helpful labeling is able to learn automata with a reduced number
  of queries. In extremis, there exists a helpful labeling allowing the algorithm
  to learn automata even without counterexamples. We also review the correction queries
  defining them as particular types of labeling. We introduce minimal corrections,
  maximal corrections, and random corrections. An experimental approach compares the
  performance and limitations of various types of queries and corrections. The results
  show that algorithms using corrections require fewer queries in most of the cases.
