title: Online Grammar Compression for Frequent Pattern Discovery
abstract: Various grammar compression algorithms have been proposed in the last decade.
  A grammar compression is a restricted CFG deriving the string deterministically.
  An efficient grammar compression develops a smaller CFG by finding duplicated patterns
  and removing them. This process is just a frequent pattern discovery by grammatical
  inference. While we can get any frequent pattern in linear time using a preprocessed
  string, a huge working space is required for longer patterns, and the whole string
  must be loaded into the memory preliminarily. We propose an online algorithm approximating
  this problem within a compressed space. The main contribution is an improvement
  of the previously best known approximation ratio Ω(\frac1\lg^2m) to Ω(\frac1\lg^*N\lg
  m) where m is the length of an optimal pattern in a string of length N and \lg^*
  is the iteration of the logarithm base 2. For a sufficiently large N, \lg^*N is
  practically constant. The experimental results show that our algorithm extracts
  nearly optimal patterns and achieves a significant improvement in memory consumption
  compared to the offline algorithm.
