title: Flexible State-Merging for Learning (P)DFAs in Python
abstract: We present a Python package for learning (non-)probabilistic deterministic
  finite state automata and provide heuristics in the red-blue framework. As our package
  is built along the API of the popular scikit-learn package, it is easy to use and
  new learning methods are easy to add. It provides PDFA learning as an additional
  tool for sequence prediction or classification to data scientists, without the need
  to understand the algorithm itself but rather the limitations of PDFA as a model.
  With applications of automata learning in diverse fields such as network traffic
  analysis, software engineering and biology, a stratified package opens opportunities
  for practitioners.
