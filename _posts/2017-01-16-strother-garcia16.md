title: 'Using Model Theory for Grammatical Inference: a Case Study from Phonology'
abstract: This paper examines the characterization and learning of grammars defined
  by conjunctions of negative and positive literals (CNPL) where the literals correspond
  to structures in an enriched model theory of strings. CNPL logic represents an intermediate
  between conjunctions of negative literals (CNL) and a propositional-style logic,
  both of which have been well-studied in terms of the language classes they describe.
  Model-theoretic approaches to formal language theory have traditionally assumed
  that each position in a string belongs to exactly one unary relation. Using enriched
  models (which do no satisfy this assumption) presents a new avenue for investigation
  with potential applications in several fields including linguistics, planning and
  control, and molecular biology. We demonstrate the value of such structures and
  CNPL logic with a particular learning problem in phonology.
