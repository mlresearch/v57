  the Next Symbol in a Sequence'
abstract: The Sequence PredIction ChallengE (SPiCe) is an on-line competition that
  took place between March and July 2016. Each of the 15 problems was made of a set
  of whole sequences as training sample, a validation set of prefixes, and a test
  set of prefixes. The aim was to submit a ranking of the 5 most probable symbols
  to be the next symbol of each prefix.
