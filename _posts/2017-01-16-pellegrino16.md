title: Learning Deterministic Finite Automata from Infinite Alphabets
abstract: We proposes an algorithm to learn automata infinite alphabets, or at least
  too large to enumerate. We apply it to define a generic model intended for regression,
  with transitions constrained by intervals over the alphabet. The algorithm is based
  on the Red & Blue framework for learning from an input sample. We show two small
  case studies where the alphabets are respectively the natural and real numbers,
  and show how nice properties of automata models like interpretability and graphical
  representation transfer to regression where typical models are hard to interpret.
