title: Simple K-star Categorial Dependency Grammars and their Inference
abstract: We propose a novel subclass  in the family of Categorial Dependency Grammars
  (CDG), based on a syntactic criterion on categorial types associated to words in
  the lexicon and study its learnability. This proposal relies on  a linguistic principle
  and relates to a former non-constructive condition on iterated dependencies. We
  show that the projective CDG in this subclass are incrementally learnable in the
  limit from dependency structures. In contrast to previous proposals, our criterion
  is both syntactic and  does not impose a (rigidity) bound on the number of categorial
  types associated to a word.
