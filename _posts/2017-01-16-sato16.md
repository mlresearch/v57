title: Evaluation of Machine Learning Methods on SPiCe
abstract: In this paper, we introduce methods that we used to solve problems from
  the sequence prediction competition called SPiCe. We train a model from sequences
  in train data on each problem, and then predict a next symbol following each sequence
  in test data. We implement several methods to solve these problems. The experiment
  results show that XGBoost and neural network approaches have good performance overall.
