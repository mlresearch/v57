title: A Spectral Method that Worked Well in the SPiCe’16 Competition
abstract: We present methods used in our submission to the Sequence Prediction ChallengE
  (SPiCe’16). The two methods used to solve the competition tasks were spectral learning
  and a count based method. Spectral learning led to better results on most of the
  problems.
